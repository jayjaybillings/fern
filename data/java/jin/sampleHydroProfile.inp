Notes:  This is a sample hydro profile (remove these notes to use).  It is
white-space delimited.  First row is ignored when read, but must
have four labels without whitespace.  The first column of each data row is
an arbitrary index that is ignored, but it must be present.  Any number of
rows may be entered, but it is assumed that the time increases with each row.
