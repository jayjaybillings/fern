File specifying reaction groups for partial equilibrium approx. Anything
before triple dollar signs taken as comments.  First put integer specifying
number of groups.  Follow with number of reaction elements in group,
followed by one line for each reaction element of the group specifying Z, N,
reaction serial index, and reaction label (reaction labels will be ignored on
read-in but must have NO BLANK SPACES). Repeat for each reaction group.
Entries are white-space delimited; extra whitespace and blank lines ignored.
See method readReactionGroups() in StochasticElements for details,
and see the inner class Reactions defined in StochasticElements.java
for the definition of Reaction objects used to form the reaction groups.
