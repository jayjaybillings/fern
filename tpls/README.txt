This directory holds the Third Party Libraries (TPLs) that are used by FERN.
Each directory contains the original distribution of the TPL as well as a 
VERSION.txt file that describes the version and source for the TPL. This extra
file also describes where the copyright and license for the TPL can be found.
Finally, it also contains a CMakeLists.txt if necessary.
